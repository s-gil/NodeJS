If we need to query a database, the thread does not have to wait for database to return the data; while database is executing the query, the thread  will be used to serve another client. When the database prepares the result, it puts a message in something called EVENT QUEUE. Node is monitoring queue constinuosly in background. When it finds an event it will take it out and process it. \n",
